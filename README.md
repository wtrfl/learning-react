# my react learning adventure

hello, i am waterfall, and i've made it my mission to bridge my knowledge gaps in react. this repository will hold all of my projects that i've built to master skills since then.

each project is sorted in it's own folder in src/

look out for the home page, coming soon!

more info:
all projects are built with
- react.js with vite
- tailwind css
- typescript
